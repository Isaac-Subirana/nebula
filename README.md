# System requirements
Keep in mind these were the system requirements at the time of these README's last update. They may vary over time.
* An x86-64 machine with at least 8 GB of RAM. More than 16 GB is recommended -and the compilation time will still be really long. 64+ GB are not excessive. 20+ CPU cores are not excessive either.
* At least 100GB of free disk space (more accurately described in each operating system's instructions). An SSD is recommended, to improve download and compilation times.
* Git (or [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) if you're on Windows) installed.

# Recommended apps
* [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) (if you're on Windows), very useful for finding specific files in large folders (such as Chromium).
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), to search for specific project strings and bulk-modifying these. 
* [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) (if you're on Windows), for running `.sh` scripts (related to icon modification or testing).

# Get the code
Please read the instructions on how to get the code for your operating system from [the Chromium project documentation](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/docs/get_the_code.md).
